# Sinatra Playground

You may think Sinatra is just a blue-eyed singing mobster from the early 20th
century; but he's *also* a really tiny web application framework!

With sinatra; we can:

1. Generate a web page based upon the data we have
1. Take and process data from a user OVER THE INTERNET (instead of the command
   line!)

This week we're going to play around with making a web application!
